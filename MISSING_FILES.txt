CRITICAL FILES NOT IN GIT REPOSITORY
====================================

⚠️  IMPORTANT: These files are REQUIRED for app.py to run but are excluded from Git due to size limitations.

MISSING FILES NEEDED FOR INFERENCE:
-----------------------------------

📁 emotion_classifier_model/
├── ❌ model.safetensors (267MB)           ← CRITICAL: Main model weights
├── ❌ pytorch_model.bin (267MB)           ← Alternative format (optional)
├── ❌ training_args.bin (8KB)             ← Training configuration
├── ✅ config.json                         ← Included in Git
├── ✅ tokenizer.json                      ← Included in Git  
├── ✅ tokenizer_config.json               ← Included in Git
├── ✅ vocab.txt                           ← Included in Git
├── ✅ label_mappings.json                 ← Included in Git
└── ✅ special_tokens_map.json             ← Included in Git

WHAT HAPPENS WITHOUT THESE FILES:
---------------------------------
❌ app.py will FAIL with error: "Model not found"
❌ Cannot load pre-trained weights
❌ Cannot perform emotion classification
✅ Training scripts will still work (create new model)

HOW TO GET MISSING FILES:
------------------------
Option 1: Train the model yourself
    python train_distilbert_optimized.py --csv_path EmotionDetection_sample.csv

Option 2: Obtain from model creator
    - Request emotion_classifier_model/ directory
    - Ensure model.safetensors is included (267MB)
    - Copy entire directory to project root

Option 3: Download from cloud storage (if provided)
    - Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
    - Extract to emotion_classifier_model/ directory

VERIFICATION:
------------
Check if you have required files:
    ls -la emotion_classifier_model/

Required output should include:
    model.safetensors (267MB)
    config.json
    label_mappings.json
    tokenizer files

FILE SIZES:
----------
model.safetensors: ~267MB (Main model weights)
config.json: ~500 bytes
tokenizer files: ~700KB total
label_mappings.json: ~300 bytes

WHY EXCLUDED FROM GIT:
---------------------
- GitHub file size limit: 100MB per file
- model.safetensors is 267MB (too large)
- Repository would be 267MB+ (not practical)
- Standard practice in ML projects

SOLUTION:
--------
Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) or external storage for large model files.
For production, consider model hosting services like Hugging Face Hub.
